# Social Microservices

This repository implements a social media platform using a microservices architecture. It is designed to provide scalable, modular, and independently deployable services for core social media functionalities.

## Overview

The system is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific domain such as identity, media, posts, search, and API gateway. These services communicate with each other to deliver a cohesive social media experience.

- **Identity Service**: Manages user authentication, authorization, and profile management.  
- **Media Service**: Handles media uploads, storage, and retrieval.  
- **Post Service**: Manages creation, retrieval, and management of user posts.  
- **Search Service**: Provides search capabilities across posts and users.

## Features

- Modular microservice architecture  
- Independent deployment and scaling of services  
- RESTful APIs for each service
